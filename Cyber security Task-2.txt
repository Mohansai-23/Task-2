In the above sample email-1 there are no spelling or grammar mistakes however there is lack of details, suspicious email address and the sender is trying to trick the recipient into clicking the link provided.

In Sample email-2, along with the suspicious email address we can also see the grammar mistakes like "Netflix are requesting" instead it should be "Netflix is requesting " and "all its customers perform" instead it is supposed to be "all its customers to perform".
